* Upgraded embulk to v0.4.8
* Added guess method, which does nothing


Release 0.2.2 - 2015-02-17

* output/mysql: enhanced fetch_rows handling.
  If fetch_rows > 1, set useCursorFetch=true which enables server-side
  prepared statements. It fetches rows by chunks.
  If fetch_rows = 1, set Integer.MIN_VALUE to Statement.setFetchSize. It
  fetches rows one by one.
  If fetch_rows < 0, don't set anything. It fetches all rows at once
  to memory.


Release 0.2.1 - 2015-02-17

* Added support for DECIMAL type. DECIMAL is converted to double type
  (@shun0102++)
* output-mysql sets zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull to the connection
  parameter to avoid 'SQLException: Value '0000-00-00' can not be represented
  as java.sql.Date' exception (@shun0102++)
